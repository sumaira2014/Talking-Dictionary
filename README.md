# Talking Dictionary
A  talking dictionary built with Python that reads definitions aloud.It is an intuitive Python application developed with Tkinter, allowing users to input a word and retrieve its definition, along with audio pronunciation. It utilizes a JSON file for storing word definitions and the pyttsx3 library for text-to-speech support, enhancing accessibility and ease of use.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
Tkinter (included with standard Python installations)
pyttsx3 for text-to-speech functionality
json for data handling

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `main.py` and input a word to hear its definition.

## Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the Python and Tkinter communities for their resources, and to the pyttsx3 library for enabling text-to-speech functionality.
